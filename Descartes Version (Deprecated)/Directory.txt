    deprecated_code -> Home for old uneccesary code, including old test models, datasets and utility functions. Kept for posterity sake.
    
    development -> Home for the entire model training pipeline from tiling an entire country to using an existing model to create a prediction dataset.

Overall workflow
    Description ->
        Evaluate an existing/brand-new model on a desired country. Save that resulting csv -> Create a finer dataset based on specifications (country separated etc.), create groups and label the resulting dataset/groups. Save the resulting confirmed/denied lists into descartes Storage -> Save the confirmed/denied results locally and use it to train/re-train the model.  Save the model weights to descartes storage.
    Directory Workflow ->
        development -> (On Terminal) deploy.py -> UI_Labeling -> dl_dataset_and_model -> repeat
