frankly don't really care too much, OCD people beware and I'm sorry\\n   -Since we're pre-loading all of the UI, this function takes a large while to finish running so set aside enough time beforehand to allow the loading of the individual batched UI and for any\\n    unforseen issues\\n   -I am not overly familiar with UI/UX design or IPyWidgets overall which makes this design a bit... 'janky'.  But it does work as intended with mostly minor inconveniences, if you have more\\n    knowledge or can think of different better alternatives, feel free to do so.\\n   -Currently I have found no 'effective' way of stably using the built-in Image widget with descarteslabs arrays and am instead using individual matplotlib figures to display the individual\\n    images with the Output widget capturing the displayed output.  This is not exactly ideal since matplotlib is rather slow and loading 2500 (currently) images at once is both time and memory\\n    intensive.  I have been unable to find a workaround but using Output to capture some other diplay may be effective in speeding the process up.\\n   -Buttons are initialized beforehand, so if a user were to load the same group-batch, alter the confirmed/denied list and save it mid run, the current user would not see those changes\\n    reflected on the button colors, but would still be able to change and submit their labelings\\n\""

Some debugging information has been added to the log but otherwise that functionality has not been added due to time and scope\\n    constraints.\\n   -The next big issue is a concurrency race condition that may arise if two users saveData at around the same time.  Since the on-click function calls the storage, and edits it before saving\\n    it there is a brief window during which another user can do the same before the previous data is saved such that only the newest data is kept and the other data is lost.  In theory this\\n    isn't likely given how brief the window for it currently is and additionally may not actively be a problem if the users don't terminate the program before saving again as their 'lost' data\\n    is maintained in their personal session and can be submitted with no issues later on.\\n   -A maybe issue, maybe not is that there is a limit to the size of any storage item, and since we're only keeping one confirmed and denied object in storage, if the dataset is large enough\\n    there is a real possibility of reaching this limit without intending to.  As it stands I don't believe the issue is relevant with 20000 images as the things stored are basically strings,\\n    but it may be necessary in the future to handle this potentiality.\\n   -Besides that, most of the KNOWN_ISSUES from the loadGroup section apply doubly here and any adjustments should be made in conjunction in the hopes of improving the process. \\n\""
