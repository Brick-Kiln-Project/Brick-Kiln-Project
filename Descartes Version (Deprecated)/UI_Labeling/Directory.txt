Directory 
    State_Separated_Datasets -> Folder containing the feature separated datasets which will be used in the labeling process
    
    __init__.py -> File containing any initialized globals
    
    config.py -> File containing the descartes labs storage identifiers with which to reference their files (IS NOT COPIED OVER FROM GITHUB, MUST BE MADE)
    
    config.py.dist -> Template with which to create the config.py file, fill with relevant descarteslabs identifiers
    
    Create_State_Dataset.ipynb -> From an existing dataset, sample tiles given conditions based on brick belt and state boundaries
        IMPORTANT VARIABLES ->
            datasetName -> predicted Dataset to reference
            country -> country which to sample etc.
 
    ErrorAnalysis.ipynb -> Do some basic error analysis after labeling, using the labeled data as 'accurate' and the original prediccted data as our flawed dataset
        IMPORTANT VARIABLES ->
            datasetName -> Predicted dataset to reference
            
    Grouping.ipynb -> Iterate through all of the high and low res images and save them to the descartes labs storage while also extracting their features to pass along to the kmeans algorithm to effectively group the images into 'similar' visual groups.  These are then saved into the storage as their respective batch to be labeled.
        IMPORTANT VARIABLES ->
            LOWIMGSHAPE -> Shape of the low res image, used to extract features from an image
            BATCHSIZE -> Number of images to get per batch, ceiling of this value is dictated by the memory intensivity of loading High res images (640,640,3) at the same time
            KMEANSSIZE -> Number of maximal kmeans groups to create, set high to test for the most optimal value
            TIMEOUT -> Maximum time in seconds to allocate to any given image acquisition, ends in failure if time exceeds this value, if not specified will continue indefinitely, THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS SOME TILES ARE KNOWN TO RUN UPWARDS OF 8 HOURS WITH NO SIGN OF TERMINATING FOR UNKNOWN REASONS
            datasetName -> predicted dataset to reference
    
    Labeling.ipynb -> Iterate through the given batch and manually label whether a kiln exists within the image or not.
        IMPORTANT VARIABLES ->
            IMGSHOWN -> number of images to show in total per page, limited for viewing purposes
            NUMIMGROW -> number of images to show per row, limited for viewing purposes
            datasetName -> predicted dataset to reference
    
    LabelingError.ipynb -> Very similar to the Labeling.ipynb and ErrorAnalysis.ipynb files, used to do error analysis by a third person on an existing dataset.
